                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For new chess players, it can be hard to understand
                the importance of practicing tactics, and particularily
                young players can have a hard time focusing on a
                sometimes boring task. Secondarily, young players are
                often too focused on their tactics rating to take chances
                against ruining their statistics. This iOS and Android
                does away with the ratings, but also presents tactics
                in a much more ingaging and fun way. We call this gamemode
                'Blitz,' but we do have two other more relaxing gamemodes
                for training your chess vision ('Levels' and 'Endless').
                Created with React Native (Javascript), the app started
                production in November 2018 and the first design was
                finished by Janurary 2019. When we started the project
                in November, 'Blitz' was an original idea, but apparently
                we weren't the only ones to think of it. Chess.com (the
                most popular platform for online chess) released a similar
                game called 'Puzzle Rush' just a month into our development.
